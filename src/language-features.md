# Extra Language Features

To make the desugarings possible/easier, this book takes the liberty to assume a few extra Rust
features available; this section describes them.
A number of them have been proposed by others at some point of other, some even have RFCs.
It is to be noted that a lot of them are direct translations of existing MIR operations.
